# Project Context & Backstory

## The Pitch
This project is a high-reliability management platform for luxury dog kennels, designed to be pitched to a business owner (likely an older demographic).

**Key Selling Points:**
*   Reliability
*   Speed
*   "Wow" Factor (Premium Design)

## The "Dinner Demo" Goal
The immediate objective is to build a sleek, visual mockup of the **Client Portal** (Frontend) to show on a phone during a dinner meeting. The goal is to seal the deal with a tangible demonstration of a "Login" screen and a "My Dog" dashboard.

## Payment System Strategy
The user is considering offering cryptocurrency payments but is cautious about the demographic's reception.

**Agreed Approach:**
1.  **Primary**: Stripe/Standard Payments. Positioned as the trusted, default option for the existing clientele.
2.  **Secondary**: USDC/Crypto. Framed as an "Advanced" or "Future-proof" option that can be enabled if desired, or sits quietly at the bottom of invoices.

**Rationale:**
*   Respects the existing business and older clientele.
*   Demonstrates technical sophistication ("future-proof") without alienating the core user base.
